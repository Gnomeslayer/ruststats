# ruststats
Rust stats is a small web application that allows players from the game "Rust" to quickly view their current in game stats.

If you want to use this, you first need to acquire a battlemetrics account and get an API token.
You must also have relevant permissions to view the server via battlemetrics to get the information you want to show.

You will also need a steam API token as well in order to properly pull the user information from steam.
